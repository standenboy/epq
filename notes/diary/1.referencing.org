* notes from sir's talk on referencing (1/10/24)
  - do background checks on the writer
  - the main reference systems is harvard and vancouver
** vancouver 
   for science and computer sci (ME!)
   i should use this, as my topic is about computer science and it is what latex uses
   this is what im used to reading
   CONVENTION
   the final reference list should look like this
   most import name to least important name (dont list everyone, just the first 3 then say "et al")
   then the year of publication
   the title of the document
   the name of the publication
   say the edition and volume
   then the page number

   if my source doesn't have something from that list, just skip it

   the reference list doesn't count towards my word count

   latex can handle this for me

** harvard
   for everything else
   not needed for me
