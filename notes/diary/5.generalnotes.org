* notes on sir's talk on the 17th of october
  - we are starting on the EPQ itself now as soon as all the documents get ticked off
  - expect the project to grind to a halt at points, I will need to write about this so 
    it can go in my log
  - i must make a timetable for my epq to tell everyone what i need to do and when
