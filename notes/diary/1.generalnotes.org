* had a presentation on the basics (17/09/24)
the manchester uni powerpoint
** takeaways 
- "to what extent..." questions are very easy to structure
- it might be wise to look at multiple questions and decide later
- in the conclution, you need to come to a point (ie what kind of license is better)
** rules from teacher
- no primary reasearch, only secondary (use someone elses reasearch)
- cant be self referenchal, i cant talk about my own views
- NO SERIAL KILLERS
- keep things balenced
- you need to check that things arent bias, or state that it is bias
