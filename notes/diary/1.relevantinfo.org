* notes on sir's talk on note relvancy
  - you need to stay on topic when reasearching, its easy to stray 
  - to fix this, have a solid idea of what i'm researching
  - headings are not always recomended, but in my field they are helpful
  - try and have a word count for each section, as it will make it easier to get blocks done
  - don't over invest in over planning (ie making org mode files too much)
  - skim articals before reading through them fully, it will save so much time
  - an abstract can be referenced, helpful for skimming ^
  - cut all un-needed material
