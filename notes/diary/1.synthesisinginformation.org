* synthesising information
  - this means how to put ideas into a logical argument
  - start the write up with the simple ideas, then move to the 
    hard ones to avoid them getting confused
  - focus on ease of reading, don't make it overly formal, just use what you know
  - don't repeat yourself, both on information, and on phrases, because its dull
  - avoid confusing the reader
** putting ideas in a logical order
   - look at the summarised material i have made
   - order it all
   - write from there
   - imagine im reading it for the first time, does it make sense, perhaps get someone
     elses view on it, if it doesnt make sense to them, it wont make sense to the examiner
** practical structuring
   - aim for an easy to read document
   - use formating to make it easy to read and follow, ie italics for quotes
** dont drown in text!
   - a page of solid text is painful to read, make sure line spacing is nice, paragraphs are large
     use things like bullet points, flow charts, and tables of data.
   - make sure the tables and graphs are relevant
   - pictures are okay, but only if they are relevant, i doubt my topic will have anything 
     that needs an image 
** joining things together
   - read the entirer thing through a couple days after finishing it
   - each section, should link to the next, for example, after an explination of a license, a
     breif history of it.
** the final product
   - it must answer the question
   - it must be clear
