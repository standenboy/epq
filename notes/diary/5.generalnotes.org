* notes on sir's talk on the 17th of october
  - we are starting on the EPQ itself now as soon as all the documents get ticked off
  - expect the project to grind to a halt at points, I will need to write about this so 
    it can go in my log
  - i must make a timetable for my epq to tell everyone what i need to do and when
* notes from my talk with sir
  - i asked sir if he thought the idea of setting a time frame for each section was wise, he 
    thought that for a paper of such a topic, a liner approch like this sounds good and
    effective
